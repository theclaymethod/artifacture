# Worked examples: from idea to figure

The files in `examples/` are finished figures. This document is what makes
them *reproducible*: for the two richest ones it records the regeneration
prompt (what you'd ask for), the phase-1 ASCII mock it implies, and the
phase-2 implementation notes that aren't obvious from a prompt alone. Use the
example closest to your new figure as a starting point, read its source
alongside its recipe here.

(Provenance note: which model/agent originally generated each figure was not
recorded in git, history was squashed through deploy commits. That's exactly
why these recipes exist: regeneration should depend on the skill, not on
remembering who or what drew it first.)

## The kangaroo: `example1_kangaroo.html`

**Regeneration prompt:**

> A chalkboard figure for the diffusion analogy: two side-by-side canvases
> painting the same 32×32 pixel image of a kangaroo (it's for a Sydney
> venue). Left panel "Paint sequentially, pixel by pixel" fills the image
> one cell at a time in raster order and takes ~7s. Right panel "Denoise in
> parallel, diffusion" starts as pure noise and converges every pixel at
> once in ~3.2s. When the parallel one finishes, a hook question appears:
> "What about *drafting tokens* in parallel?"

**Phase-1 mock:**

```

Beats: t=0 both start · t≈3.2 right converges + done badge + hook question
       t=7.0 left finally finishes · t=7.3 freeze
```

**How it was actually made (the process is the lesson):**

1. The author already knew the composition: left = painting sequentially,
   right = denoising. That target was fixed before any code.
2. The model was first sent to find reference images explaining diffusion,
   so it understood the concept and the speed contrast it had to dramatize,
   concept before pixels.
3. First drawing attempts **freehanded** the kangaroo (and a Sydney Opera
   House) from imagined coordinates, they came out badly; coding models
   have poor spatial sense. The fix: find a kangaroo image online and
   **trace** it. Everything became easy after that.

Divide and conquer, twice over: concept → composition → shape → fill. Use
`scripts/trace_bitmap.py` to automate the trace step.

**Implementation notes:**

- The image is a **hard-coded 32-row bitmap** of `'X'`/`'.'` strings (`ROO`
  array), traced from the Twemoji kangaroo's alpha channel
  (`trace_bitmap.py <emoji.png> --size 32` reproduces this). Grids stay
  ≤32×32; this is a chalk sketch, not a framebuffer.
- Each canvas is a CSS grid of `<i>` cells built once up front.
- Serial panel: `filled = floor(t/T_P * N)` index cutoff; the current cell
  gets a bright box-shadow "cursor"; unfilled cells flicker faintly
  (`Math.random() < 0.10` → low-alpha noise) so the untouched area feels
  alive.
- Parallel panel: per-cell random delay (0–0.55s) + smoothstep blend from
  random noise alpha to the target alpha, so convergence looks organic, not
  linear.
- Final texture must be **deterministic per cell**
  (`0.72 + ((i*37+11)%23)/100`), so the finished kangaroo looks hand-filled
  with chalk and is identical every replay/screenshot.
- The narrative trick: the *done* badge on the right appears while the left
  is still grinding, the time asymmetry IS the message. The hook question
  fades in tied to the right panel's completion, not the loop's end.

## Go to school: `example4_go_to_school.html`

(The shipped file titles its panels "INDEPENDENT TOP-1 (DFLASH)" and "PATH
SELECTION (DFLASH 2)" because it sat in a paper about those models; the prompt
below is the model-free version. It also predates the end-of-body slip script,
so its pictograms are unfiltered; a regeneration from the template will look
wobblier than the original, which is the intended look.)

**Regeneration prompt:**

> A chalkboard figure contrasting independent top-1 drafting with path
> selection. Shared setup line: verified prefix "The fastest way to __ __ __
> __". Left panel "INDEPENDENT TOP-1": four candidate columns (pos 1–4),
> each picks its own top token, producing "get **to to** school" ✗, with a
> little chalk drawing of a walker stopped at a construction barrier, and an
> acceptance curve that sags at later positions. Right panel "PATH
> SELECTION": same columns but picks form a coherent path, "get **to school
> quickly**" ✓, chalk drawing of a runner, and a flat acceptance curve.

**Phase-1 mock:**

```
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|  verified prefix: "The fastest way to __ __ __ __"           |
| +--------------------------+  +----------------------------+ |
| : INDEPENDENT TOP-1        :  : PATH SELECTION             : |
| : pos1  pos2  pos3  pos4   :  : pos1  pos2  pos3  pos4     : |
| : [get*][to*] [to*][school*]  : [get*][to*] [school*][quickly*] |
| : learn started school qui..  : ...same cols, diff picks   : |
| : "get to to school" ✗     :  : "get to school quickly" ✓  : |
| : (stick figure: blocked)  :  : (stick figure: running)    : |
| : acceptance: \_ tail sags :  : acceptance: ---- flat      : |
| +--------------------------+  +----------------------------+ |
|                                                    [replay]  |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+

Beats: 0.5 left grid · 2.2 left result ✗ · 2.5 pictogram · 2.9 note
       3.6 right grid · 5.4 right result ✓ · 7.6 acceptance curves draw
       9.4 "tail sags" annotation · freeze
```

**Implementation notes:**

- Beats are **declarative** here: every revealed element carries
  `class="el" data-t="2.2"`, and `paint(t)` is just "toggle `.show` on
  every `.el` whose `data-t ≤ t`". Prefer this variant when a figure is
  many small reveals rather than continuous motion, the beat table lives
  in the markup itself.
- Candidate columns: the chosen token gets `.pick` (brighter border); the
  colliding token additionally `.dup`, the failure tokens wrapped in
  `.bad` (and the fix in `.ok`) inside the quoted result line.
- The pictograms are tiny **hand-drawn inline SVGs** (~170×52): stick
  figures from circles + stroked paths, `stroke-linecap:round`,
  `stroke-width:1.7`, chalk color, slip filter on the whole `<svg>`.
  Draw meaning, not clip-art: blocked walker + barrier vs runner + motion
  dashes. Give each an `aria-label`.
- Acceptance curves are polyline paths revealed by the
  `stroke-dasharray/dashoffset` draw-on recipe; the sagging tail vs flat
  shape is the quantitative punchline, annotated with a chalk
  "← tail sags" note that appears late, like a teacher circling back.

## Dog and cat: `example2_dog_and_cat.html`

**Regeneration prompt:**

> A chalkboard figure making strict vs relaxed verification *felt*. Setup
> line: `"The best pet is a ___"`, where the target model says cat 50% /
> dog 50%. Two chalk toggle buttons: "strict rejection sampling" keeps the
> output at the target's 50/50; "relaxed rule" drifts it to 20/80. Show a
> 🐈 and a 🐕 whose sizes ARE the distribution, under the relaxed rule the
> dog visibly balloons. Verdict line: "the output keeps the target's 50/50"
> vs "the best pet becomes a dog".

**Phase-1 mock:**

```
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|        "The best pet is a ___"                               |
|                                                              |
|   [strict rejection sampling]*   [ relaxed rule ]            |
|                                                              |

|   (emoji font-size = share: relaxed -> small cat, HUGE dog)  |
|                                                              |
|        the output keeps the target's 50/50                   |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+

No timeline: this is a TOGGLE figure. Beats table is just the two states:
strict -> 50/50 · relax -> 20/80 + verdict swap.
```

**Implementation notes:**

- This is the **mode-toggle** variant: no clock, no replay eraser, the two
  chalk buttons are the whole control surface, and `render(mode)` plays the
  role of `paint(t)` (same idempotency rule: each mode renders from
  scratch).
- The data-carrying trick: `fontSize = 40 + 130 * share`, the emoji IS the
  bar chart. No axes, no bars, and the point lands harder because it's a
  dog getting fat.
- Numbers stay on screen (`50%`/`80%` under each pet) so the joke never
  replaces the quantity, fun carries the data, it doesn't hide it.
- Toggle buttons are chalk pills: current mode gets `.on` (brighter border
  + fill); both slip-filtered like everything else.
- The verdict line is the wink, written deadpan: "the best pet becomes a
  dog". One wink per figure.

## The rest, in one line each

- `example3_rejection_sampling.html`: mostly-static diagram: nine timed
  reveals over 7s, no playhead. Predates the slip filters and the `paint(t)`
  model (it uses a `setTimeout` chain), so copy its layout ideas (token
  columns, correction written above the chip, p/q bar pairs), not its code.
- `example5_decoding_race.html`: the full decoding race: many moving chips, one shared
  time axis; the maximal version of the chips + progress pattern.
- `example7_dflash_flat_cost.html`: slider-driven: `paint(sliderValue)`
  instead of `paint(clockTime)`; SVG cost curves + a reading line. Sweeps
  itself 1→16 on load (about 4s), then stays draggable; see the sliders recipe
  in `animation-patterns.md` for the two-argument `paint(g, reveal)` that makes
  sweep and drag coexist. Chart lines are sampled every 0.5 γ with a
  deterministic ±1px wobble so they are not ruler-straight.
- `example8_dflash_kv_injection.html`: the multi-diagram figure: several
  labeled SVG panels on one board; shows how far pure hand-drawn SVG
  (paths + text, slip-filtered) can carry an architecture explanation.
- `example6_twin_timelines.html`: twin timeline panels (vanilla vs speculative), the
  canonical chips/chunks/playhead/status construction.
