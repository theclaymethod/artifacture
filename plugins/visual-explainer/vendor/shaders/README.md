## Why Shaders?

-   **Real WebGPU, declarative API:** 200+ effects you drop in as components. Gradients, noise, glass, metal, light, distortions, transitions, blurs, cursor effects. Nest them, blend them, mask them.
-   **A design editor that writes your code:** design on an infinite canvas at [shaders.com](https://shaders.com), then export the exact component tree for your framework. Free.
-   **Every framework, one package:** first-class React, Vue, Svelte, Solid and JavaScript entries, with the same props everywhere.
-   **Production-ready:** TypeScript, extensively optimized, typed props with reactive updates, SSR safe. Used on thousands of websites by 16,000+ design engineers.

## 🧩 Components

Every effect is a component. `<Shader>` renders the canvas; its children are layers, evaluated top to bottom and blended on the GPU.

### React

```jsx
import { Shader, LinearGradient, CursorTrail } from 'shaders/react'

<Shader className="w-full h-64">
  <LinearGradient colorA="#0f172a" colorB="#7c3aed" />
  <CursorTrail />
</Shader>
```

Get started with [Shaders for React](https://shaders.com/react).

### Vue

```html
<script setup>
import { Shader, LinearGradient, CursorTrail } from 'shaders/vue'
</script>

<template>
  <Shader class="w-full h-64">
    <LinearGradient colorA="#0f172a" colorB="#7c3aed" />
    <CursorTrail />
  </Shader>
</template>
```

Get started with [Shaders for Vue](https://shaders.com/vue).

### Svelte

```svelte
<script>
  import { Shader, LinearGradient, CursorTrail } from 'shaders/svelte'
</script>

<Shader class="w-full h-64">
  <LinearGradient colorA="#0f172a" colorB="#7c3aed" />
  <CursorTrail />
</Shader>
```

Get started with [Shaders for Svelte](https://shaders.com/svelte).

### Solid

```tsx
import { Shader, LinearGradient, CursorTrail } from 'shaders/solid'

<Shader class="w-full h-64">
  <LinearGradient colorA="#0f172a" colorB="#7c3aed" />
  <CursorTrail />
</Shader>
```

Get started with [Shaders for Solid](https://shaders.com/solid).

### JavaScript

```javascript
import { createShader } from 'shaders/js'

await createShader(document.getElementById('my-shader'), {
  components: [
    { type: 'LinearGradient', props: { colorA: '#0f172a', colorB: '#7c3aed' } },
    { type: 'CursorTrail' },
  ],
})
```

## 🎨 Design visually, export code

Most people don't write their effects by hand. They design them.

The [design editor](https://shaders.com/design-editor) at shaders.com is an infinite canvas where you stack components, tune every prop with real controls, drive props from the cursor or a timeline, and see the result live. When it looks right, **Export Code** gives you the component tree in your framework, ready to paste.

Design and export are free with an account. Your work is saved as projects you can come back to.

[Open the design editor](https://shaders.com/design-editor)

## ⌨️ CLI

The CLI connects a codebase to your Shaders account, so the effects you design land in your project as real component files and stay in sync.

```bash
npx shaders connect        # link this codebase to a Shaders project
npx shaders install        # pick shaders from that project; writes component files
npx shaders update         # pull in what you changed in the editor
```

It detects your framework, writes to your components folder, and records what it installed in a lock file. Nothing to install globally.

Read the [CLI guide](https://shaders.com/docs/guide/cli).

## 🤖 Using Shaders with AI

Give your coding agent the same tools you have:

-   **MCP server:** `npx shaders@latest install-mcp` configures Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Windsurf, Copilot and others. Your agent can find, install and edit the shaders you design. Works on any account, free included. [MCP guide](https://shaders.com/docs/guide/mcp).
-   **llms.txt:** [shaders.com/llms.txt](https://shaders.com/llms.txt) indexes every docs page, and [shaders.com/llms-full.txt](https://shaders.com/llms-full.txt) carries the full component reference with props, defaults and ranges.

## ⚡️ Shaders Pro

Everything above is free. [Pro](https://shaders.com/pricing) adds the library and the workflow around it:

-   **1,000+ production-ready presets**, organised into collections
-   **55+ website sections**, complete and ready to drop in
-   **HD video and image rendering** without a watermark
-   **One-click install inside Framer** with the [Framer plugin](https://shaders.com/framer)
-   **Unlimited version history** in the editor
-   **Pro presets through the CLI and MCP**
-   **Exclusive Discord role and channel**, priority support, all future updates

[See pricing](https://shaders.com/pricing)

## 🧪 Build your own component

If you need a brand new component, you can write one. A component is a plain object passed to `defineShader`: a name, its props, and what to draw at each pixel. Mount it with `<CustomShader>` like any other component.

```ts
import { defineShader, wgsl, transformColor, transformPosition } from 'shaders/std'

export const Halo = defineShader({
  name: 'Halo',
  props: {
    color: { default: '#ffd166', transform: transformColor },
    center: { default: { x: 0.5, y: 0.5 }, transform: transformPosition },
    radius: { default: 0.6 },
  },
  paint: wgsl`
    let d = length((uv - center) * vec2f(aspect, 1.0)) / radius;
    return vec4f(color.rgb, 1.0 - smoothstep(0.8, 1.0, d));
  `,
})
```

The guide covers both ways to write the pixel part: composing it from the std primitives (experimental) or writing WGSL directly (stable). [Custom Components](https://shaders.com/docs/guide/custom-shaders) · [Primitives reference](https://shaders.com/docs/primitives)

## 👩🏻‍⚖️ License

-   The engine, every component and the framework bindings in this repository and the `shaders` npm package are [MIT licensed](./LICENSE).
-   The design editor, presets, sections and other platform features at shaders.com are separate from this package and have their own [terms](https://shaders.com/license).

## 💎 Contribute

Issues and pull requests are welcome. View the [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) before starting, and for anything more than a bug fix, open an issue to discuss it before the PR.

The engine lives in `packages/core`, with one folder per component under `src/shaders/`. The framework packages are generated from it.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm lib:build   # build every package (regenerates the registry and framework components)
pnpm test        # the engine's test suite
```
