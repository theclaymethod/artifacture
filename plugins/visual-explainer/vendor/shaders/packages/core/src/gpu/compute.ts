 * 1. **One bind-group family only.** A sim almost never has just one pass per orientation.
 *    CursorRipples propagates over the buffer pair AND runs a gradient pass that reads whichever
 *    buffer was just written; ReactionDiffusion reacts N times then runs an output copy. This
 *    helper can express exactly one `make(read, write)` family, so those shaders had to keep
 *    their own orientation flag anyway — at which point the helper adds nothing.
 * 2. **No orientation query.** `current` hands back a bind group and nothing else, so a pass
 *    that needs "the resource the current orientation reads/wrote" (every output/display copy)
 *    cannot be built from it.
 * 3. **Eager construction.** The bind groups are built at call time. Every child-consuming sim
 *    (TimeTrail, DataMosh, KeyFrames, ReactionDiffusion-with-child) can only build its groups
 *    inside `bindInputs`, after the pass manager allocates the child RTT.
 *
 * Kept (not deleted) so the deprecation is visible at the call site if anything external adopted it.
