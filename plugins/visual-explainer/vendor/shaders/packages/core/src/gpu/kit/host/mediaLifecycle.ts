/**
 * CPU-side media lifecycle helpers — the loading half of the texture shaders.
 *
 * None of this is GPU code. It is the bookkeeping a media shader does around
 * `createMediaTexture` / `registerExternalTexture`: allocate a placeholder, fetch and decode a
 * source, swap the backing texture when the size changes, and tear the whole thing down on cleanup
 * without writing into a destroyed texture. It lives under `gpu/kit/host/` because shader
 * definitions are its only consumers (PRIMITIVES.md C9).
 *
 * The four pieces here were hand-rolled in seven shaders and had drifted:
 *
 *   - **`createSwappableMediaTexture`** — ImageTexture's `applyImage`, Text's and HTMLInCanvas's
 *     near-identical `ensureTexSize`, and Ascii's / ObjectTracker's fixed-size halves. Only Text and
 *     HTMLInCanvas skipped the realloc when the size was unchanged; only ImageTexture and Text had a
 *     dispose guard on the write path.
 *   - **`createUrlSourceLoader`** — the `currentUrl` / `isLoading` / `isDisposed` state machine that
 *     ImageTexture and VideoTexture each carried a copy of.
 *   - **`decodeImageSource`** — ImageTexture's bitmap-vs-SVG fork, including the distinction that
 *     makes an SVG measurable (raster size for the texture, INTRINSIC size for layout).
 *   - **`createVideoElementSource`** — VideoTexture's and WebcamTexture's video-element lifecycle and
 *     the shared readiness gate, and the ONE place a Firefox `importExternalTexture` fallback can
 *     later land.
 *
 * Structural-vs-runtime (C5) does not apply — this is all CPU — but two lifecycle rules do, and both
 * are load-bearing:
 *
 *   1. **Check disposal after every `await`.** A shader can be cleaned up while a fetch is in flight;
 *      writing into a destroyed texture is a WebGPU validation error. The `ctx.isDisposed()` hook on
 *      the loader callbacks exists for exactly this, and the texture handle guards itself as well.
 *   2. **A failed load does not commit its URL.** The per-frame URL watch retries a URL that never
 *      committed — which is why a permanently broken URL retries (and logs) every frame. That is
 *      pre-existing behaviour, preserved here deliberately; the fix belongs with the retry policy,
 *      not with this extraction.
