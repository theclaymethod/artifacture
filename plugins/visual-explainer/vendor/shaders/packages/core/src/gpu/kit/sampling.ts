/**
 * Reconstruction filters for resampling an RTT.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Every distortion has two code paths: the analytic one, where its UV remap is
 * folded into the coordinate the content underneath is generated at (no resampling at all, so
 * nothing to filter), and the RTT one, where the composed child is rasterised to a texture first
 * and then re-sampled at the remapped coordinate. On the RTT path the hardware `linearClamp`
 * sampler gives a single bilinear tap, and bilinear MAGNIFICATION of a high-contrast edge — text,
 * a logo, a clip-mask boundary — reconstructs it as a piecewise-linear ramp across the texel grid.
 * That reads as faceted, stair-stepped "pixellation": the artifact is the filter, not the
 * resolution.
 *
 * Catmull-Rom fixes the reconstruction: a C1, interpolating cubic whose negative lobes keep edges
 * looking crisp instead of smeared. The 9-tap form below is the standard Jimenez trick — the 4×4
 * cubic footprint is evaluated as 3×3 BILINEAR taps by placing the middle tap at the
 * weight-weighted centroid of the inner two texels, so the hardware filter does a third of the
 * work for us (16 texel fetches → 9 bilinear fetches).
 *
 * Per-axis positions and weights are separate DualFns so both are golden-testable on the CPU; the
 * Expr-level builder memoises all four into locals, so each is evaluated ONCE per use rather than
 * re-emitted per tap.
 *
 * The negative lobes can undershoot below zero on a hard edge. The result is clamped at 0 because
 * the RTT holds PREMULTIPLIED alpha and a negative alpha would blow up the unpremultiply divide
 * downstream. Overshoot ABOVE the neighbourhood max is deliberately left alone — that is the
 * edge acutance Catmull-Rom is here for, and the final tonemap handles the range.

/**
 * Cubic B-SPLINE tap setup for a square texture of `gridSize` texels, as four hardware-bilinear
 * taps plus their weights (weights sum to 1).
 *
 * Where Catmull-Rom above is an INTERPOLATING filter for reconstructing image detail, the B-spline
 * is an APPROXIMATING one: it does not pass through the texel values, it smooths them, and it is
 * C1 — the reason to reach for it is a low-resolution FIELD whose derivative is visible. Hardware
 * bilinear is only C0, so a displacement field sampled bilinearly kinks at every cell border and a
 * sharp edge dragged by the field renders each kink as a ~1-cell scallop. PixelThrow's flow grid is
 * the exemplar.
 *
 * The 4×4 cubic footprint collapses to 2 bilinear fetches per axis (offsets h0/h1 with weights
 * g0/g1) — the classic GPU Gems trick. Sampling is the CALLER's job: take the four tap UVs through
 * whatever sampler and edge mode it wants, and weight by `w.x/.y/.z/.w` in that order.
 *
 * This is a factory, not a plain fn, because `gridSize` folds into the body as a literal (C3): call
 * it once per grid size at module scope and reuse the result. Results are memoised per
 * `gridSize|fnName|structName`. Both names land verbatim in the WGSL, so a migrating shader passes
 * the names it already emitted and its snapshot does not move.
