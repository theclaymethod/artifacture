/**
 * Device/root acquisition, feature requests, device-loss hook, per-device root cache
 * (WeakMap), and per-canvas context configuration.
 *
 * ## One device per page
 *
 * Unless a caller injects its own, every renderer on the page shares ONE lazily-created
 * GPUDevice — the "default root". The first `<Shader>` to mount creates it; every later one
 * adopts it, with no configuration from the developer.
 *
 * This matters more than it looks. A GPUDevice owns the browser's compiled-pipeline cache,
 * so a device per renderer means:
 *   - the same shader recompiles once per instance instead of once per page, and
 *   - an SPA route change destroys the device with the outgoing component, throwing the
 *     cache away, so the next route recompiles everything from scratch. On Windows, where
 *     Chrome compiles through HLSL and the graphics driver, that shows up as a main-thread
 *     stall of hundreds of milliseconds to seconds — visible as scroll freezing mid-navigation.
 *
 * Sharing one device also keeps a page well under browser limits on concurrent devices and
 * cuts adapter/device requests to one.
 *
 * The default device is deliberately never destroyed by a renderer's `cleanup()` — outliving
 * the components is the entire point (that's what preserves the cache across route changes).
 * It is released when the page goes away, or explicitly via {@link destroyDefaultGpuDevice}.
